In contrast to a sole focus on areas like data mining, machine learning, or information management systems, this course aims to furnish students with a holistic grasp of the multifaceted roles performed by diverse data and analytics disciplines within the intricate landscape of business decision-making. By reviewing numerous real world business cases and engaging in the exploration of two data mining case studies, the course facilitates an experiential learning process. This process emphasizes the interconnected nature of these disciplines, contributing to the cultivation of a thorough comprehension of data-driven decision-making. This heightened understanding empowers students to thoughtfully select their advanced analytics courses and strategically navigate their individual paths toward specialized or advanced training in fields aligned with data analytics.\nClass: Mondays (2:30 pm to 3:20 pm), HAMP 3144\nCourse Website: https://davi-moreira.github.io/2025S_data_mining_purdue_MGMT173/\n\nInstructor: Professor Davi Moreira\n\nEmail: dmoreira@purdue.edu\nVirtual Office hours - Zoom link in your Course Brightspace Page\n\nMondays 4-5:00pm, and by appointment.",
