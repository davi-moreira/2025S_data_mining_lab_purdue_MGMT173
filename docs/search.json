    "text": "Course Description and Objectives\nThis course emphasizes exposure to diverse data mining methods, with a particular focus on experimental designs and predictive modeling techniques. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the roles that data and analytics disciplines play in business decision-making. Through the analysis of synthetic, business-focused datasets, students will engage in a hands-on experiential learning process that highlights the practical applications of these methods. This approach underscores the interconnected nature of experimental and predictive techniques within the broader analytics landscape, enabling students to develop a nuanced appreciation of data-driven decision-making. By the end of the course, students will be better equipped to thoughtfully select advanced analytics courses and strategically navigate their paths toward specialized or advanced training in fields aligned with data analytics.\nCourse Website: https://davi-moreira.github.io/2025S_data_mining_purdue_MGMT173/\n\nInstructor: Professor Davi Moreira\n\nEmail: dmoreira@purdue.edu\nVirtual Office hours - Zoom link in your Course Brightspace Page\nIndividual Appointments: Book time with me through the link in the course syllabus on your Course Brightspace Page or by appointment.",

It provides a comprehensive understanding of the various roles that data and analytics disciplines play in business decision-making. Through the analysis of numerous synthetic, business-focused datasets, students will engage in a hands-on experiential learning process that highlights the practical applications of these methods. This approach underscores the interconnected nature of experimental and predictive techniques within the broader analytics landscape, enabling students to develop a nuanced appreciation of data-driven decision-making. By the end of the course, students will be better equipped to thoughtfully select advanced analytics courses and strategically navigate their paths toward specialized or advanced training in fields aligned with data analytics.\nCourse Website: https://davi-moreira.github.io/2025S_data_mining_lab_purdue_MGMT173/",

Final letter grades are determined by curving final percentages, subject to any extra-credit exceptions discussed in this syllabus. While you will see your final percentage in Brightspace, individual grade thresholds will not be disclosed before official submissions.\n\n\n\nAssessment\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nAttendance/Participation\n10%\n\n\nQuizzes\n25%\n\n\nHomework\n25%\n\n\nOnline Midterm Exams\n20%\n\n\nFinal Project\n20%\n\n\n\n\nAttendance and Participation\nAttend class, participate in activities, and complete any participatory exercises. Random attendance checks will be used to measure involvement. According to Purdue regulations, students are expected to attend every class/lab meeting for which they are registered.\n\n\nQuizzes\nRegular quizzes based on lecture material will be administered, with no drops. Due dates and details will be on Brightspace. Quizzes help reinforce content and maintain steady engagement.\n\n\nHomework\nHomework assignments offer practical, hands-on exposure to data mining tasks. Expect multiple-choice questions requiring analysis of provided results. Deadlines will be posted in Brightspace. These assignments are crucial for building technical and analytical skills.\n\n\nOnline Midterm Exams\nTwo midterm exams, administered online, incorporate the methods used in quizzes and homework but in a more comprehensive format. They are open-book and open-notes. Students have 60 minutes to complete multiple-choice questions that test both technical proficiency and conceptual understanding. The second midterm is not cumulative. Makeup exams are granted only for verifiable, exceptional circumstances (e.g., serious personal medical emergency, family death, NCAA conflict).\n\n\nFinal Project\nIn groups, students will complete a practical data mining project, culminating in a team presentation submitted via Brightspace. The project provides an opportunity to apply course concepts to a real-world scenario, demonstrating analytical and problem-solving skills. Detailed guidelines will be provided according to the course schedule.\n\n\nGrade Challenges\nGrades and solutions will be posted soon after each assignment deadline. Students have 7 calendar days from the grade posting to submit any challenge (3 days for the final two quizzes and homework assignments). Challenges must be based on legitimate discrepancies regarding data mining principles or grading accuracy.\n\nReview posted solutions thoroughly.\n\nIf you suspect an error, email Dr. Moreira with:\n\nCourse name, section, and lecture day/time\n\nYour name and Student ID\n\nAssignment/Exam Title or Number\n\nSpecific deduction questioned\n\nClear rationale referencing solutions or rubrics\n\n\n\nNo grades will be discussed in-class.
