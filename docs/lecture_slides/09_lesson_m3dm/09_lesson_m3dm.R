# 
# - **Inferential Data Analysis**: In contrast, this step refines available data, identifying valuable information such as potential patterns, relationships, trends, and assessing their reliability.

# # The History of Summary Statistics {background-color="#cfb991"}
# 
# ## The History of Summary Statistics
# 
# The concept of summary statistics has its origins in ancient times, with early civilizations collecting and analyzing data. However, the formal development and systematic application of summary statistics emerged during the 19th and 20th centuries, thanks to significant contributions from statisticians and mathematicians.
# 
# ## Mid-20th Century Developments
# 
# The mid-20th century witnessed the development of computers and the growth of data-driven disciplines, which further popularized the application of summary statistics. 
# 
# Statisticians and researchers began to formalize and expand the range of summary statistics available for different types of data.
# 
# ## Late 20th Century to Present
# 
# The late 20th century saw the proliferation of statistical software and spreadsheet tools, facilitating the widespread use of summary statistics across various fields. 
# 
# As data analysis continues to evolve, summary statistics remain a fundamental tool for efficiently understanding and interpreting data.
# 
# --->
# 
# # Obtaining Summary Statistics with R {background-color="#cfb991"}
# 
# ## Obtaining Summary Statistics with R
# 
# Summary statistics, often referred to as descriptive statistics, encompass various measures, including those of:
# 
# - **Central tendency** (e.g., mean, median, mode)
# 
# - **Measures of dispersion** (e.g., variance, standard deviation, range)
# 
# - **Measures of shape** (e.g., skewness, kurtosis)
# 
# ::: {.fragment}
# 
# These summary statistics provide specific insights into data distribution and characteristics. They are indispensable in data analysis across domains like statistics, data science, social sciences, finance, and business. 
# 
# :::
# 
# ## Purposes of Descriptive Statistics in Data Mining
# 
# Descriptive statistics serve multiple purposes, including:
# 
# 1. **Summarizing data**: This involves calculating summary statistics for variables, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and frequency distribution.
# 
# ::: {.fragment}
# 
# In R, you can use functions like:
# 
# ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# summary(), mean(), median(), and table()
# ```
# 
# to summarize data.
# 
# 2. **Exploring relationships**: This involves exploring relationships between two or more variables to identify correlations or associations.
# 
# :::
# ::: {.fragment}
# 
# In R, you can use functions like:
# 
# ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# cor() and cov()
# ```
# 
# to obtain relationship-related summary statistics.
# 
# :::
# 
# ## Understanding Summary Statistics for Different Data Types
# 
# Different data types may require distinct descriptive statistics. 
# 
# - **Numeric variables** have statistics like mean, median, variance, etc.
# 
# - **Categorical data** have meaningful statistics like count and proportion.
# 
# ::: {.fragment}
# 
# When applying the `R` function `summary()` to variable(s), it automatically generates descriptive statistics tailored to the data type. For character data, which is not meant for calculation, no descriptive statistics are generated.

# # Exploring the `mtcars` Dataset in `R` {background-color="#cfb991"}
# 
# ## Exploring the `mtcars` Dataset in `R`
# 
# To explore the `mtcars` dataset, you can:
# 
# - Open the `CarDataMining` script created in previous lessons.
# 
# - Add and run the following code.
# 
# ::: {.fragment}
# 
# ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
 
summary(mtcars)
 
# ```
# 
# This code obtains a set of summary statistics for all variables in the data file.
# 
# :::
# 
# ## Comparing Summary Statistics for Numeric and Categorical Variables
# 
# <br>
# 
# You can compare summary statistics that `R` generates for numeric and categorical variables:
# 
# <br>
# 
# ```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}

mtcars$am1 <- as.factor(mtcars$am)

summary(mtcars$am1)

# ```
# 
# <br>
# 
# Since the variable `am` is numerical and `am1` is defined as categorical, `summary()` produces different statistics for them.
# 
# 
# ## Calculating Specific Summary Statistics in R

# 
# - To explore relationships between variables:
